Prerequisite
========================================
CCNx must be installed.

Installation
========================================
Default installation:
./configure
make
sudo make install

To install in a different path, run
./configure --prefix=/different/path
If CCNx is not installed in the default path, run
./configure LDFLAGS=-L/CCNx/path/lib CFLAGS=-I/CCNx/path/include

ccnpingserver
========================================
Usage: ./ccnpingserver ccnx:/name/prefix [options]
Starts a CCN ping server that responds to Interests with name ccnx:/name/prefix/ping/number.
  [-x freshness] - set FreshnessSeconds
  [-d] - run server in daemon mode
  [-h] - print this message and exit

ccnping
========================================
Usage: ./ccnping ccnx:/name/prefix [options]
Ping a CCN name prefix using Interests with name ccnx:/name/prefix/ping/number.
The numbers in the Interests are randomly generated unless specified.
  [-i interval] - set ping interval in seconds (minimum 0.1 second)
  [-c count] - set total number of pings
  [-n number] - set the starting number, the number is increamented by 1 after each Interest
  [-p identifier] - add identifier to the Interest names before the numbers to avoid conflict
  [-a] - allow routers to return ping Data from cache
  [-t] - print timestamp
  [-h] - print this message and exit


Test connectivity
========================================
ccnpingserver is usually run on a hub which announces its own name prefix. For example, on the Arizona hub, ccnpingserver is started by running "ccnpingserver /ndn/arizona.edu". Then other nodes can run "ccnping /ndn/arizona.edu" to test the connectivity towards /ndn/arizona.edu.
